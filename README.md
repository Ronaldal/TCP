# Introduction to C Language Server with TCP Connection and Postman Integration

I'm thrilled to introduce a server implementation in the C language, designed to operate seamlessly over TCP connections. This server offers robust functionality for handling client requests efficiently, making it ideal for various network applications.

## Server Features:
**TCP Connection Handling:**   The server is built to manage TCP connections effectively, ensuring reliable communication between clients and the server.

**Concurrency:** Implemented with support for handling multiple client connections concurrently, optimizing resource utilization and overall performance.

**Request Processing:** Capable of processing various types of client requests, such as data retrieval, manipulation, and updates, providing a versatile platform for diverse applications.

**Error Handling:** Equipped with comprehensive error handling mechanisms to maintain stability and resilience in the face of unexpected events or erroneous input.

## Postman Integration:
To streamline the testing and development process, I've included a ready-to-use Postman collection tailored for interacting with the server. 
**This integration enables developers to:**
- Send Requests: Easily craft and send custom requests to the server using the intuitive interface of Postman.
  
- Test Functionality: Validate the server's responses and behavior across different scenarios, facilitating thorough testing and debugging.
  
- Debugging Support: Leverage Postman's debugging features to diagnose issues and fine-tune the server's functionality for optimal performance.
  

## How to Get Started:
- Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository containing the server implementation and Postman collection to your local environment.
- Build the Server: Follow the provided instructions to build the server from the source code. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
- Launch the Server: Run the server executable, specifying any required parameters or configuration options as needed.
- Utilize Postman: Import the included Postman collection into your Postman workspace. From there, you can begin sending requests to the server and exploring its capabilities.
